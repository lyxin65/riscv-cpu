2. REPORT DETAILS
-----------------
SYNTH-6#1 Warning
Timing of a block RAM might be sub-optimal  
The timing for the instance ram0/ram_bram/ram_reg_1_0, implemented as a block RAM, might be sub-optimal as no output register was merged into the block
Related violations: <none>

SYNTH-6#2 Warning
Timing of a block RAM might be sub-optimal  
The timing for the instance ram0/ram_bram/ram_reg_1_3, implemented as a block RAM, might be sub-optimal as no output register was merged into the block
Related violations: <none>

SYNTH-6#3 Warning
Timing of a block RAM might be sub-optimal  
The timing for the instance ram0/ram_bram/ram_reg_1_7, implemented as a block RAM, might be sub-optimal as no output register was merged into the block
Related violations: <none>

SYNTH-6#4 Warning
Timing of a block RAM might be sub-optimal  
The timing for the instance ram0/ram_bram/ram_reg_3_0, implemented as a block RAM, might be sub-optimal as no output register was merged into the block
Related violations: <none>

SYNTH-6#5 Warning
Timing of a block RAM might be sub-optimal  
The timing for the instance ram0/ram_bram/ram_reg_3_4, implemented as a block RAM, might be sub-optimal as no output register was merged into the block
Related violations: <none>

SYNTH-6#6 Warning
Timing of a block RAM might be sub-optimal  
The timing for the instance ram0/ram_bram/ram_reg_3_7, implemented as a block RAM, might be sub-optimal as no output register was merged into the block
